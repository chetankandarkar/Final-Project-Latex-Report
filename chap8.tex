\section{Scope for improvement }
\vspace{1cm} 

  \hspace{0.5cm} In the future, we can install a camera to recognise those who are permitted to enter. Keep an eye on whether people are abiding to social distancing or not. It would also assist in maintaining accurate records. To detect the body temperature, a temperature sensor could be added.We can also add a sms alert system to the sanitizer storage container to send an alert sms when the sanitizer level is low.
