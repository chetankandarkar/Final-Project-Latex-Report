 \hspace{0.5cm} Hand sanitizers are available in bottle which are directly poured onto hands, and rubbed evenly. Some bottles also have the push button to manually dispense the sanitizer liquid. We have also seen some hand sanitizer dispensers in market which are automatically pumped. However, because sanitizer containers and pump devices are designed to be compatible only between products produced by the same manufacturer, consumers must also repurchase the container for the liquid if they replace the hand sanitizer. Also there is no additional feature that is combined with this hand sanitizer dispensers.
